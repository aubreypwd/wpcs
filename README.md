# wpcs

Just a package you can install with either Composer or NPM and it will automatically install WordPress Coding Standards for:

## PHP

To _use_ WordPress Coding Standards for PHP, see [phpcs.xml.dist](phpcs.xml.dist) and either create a symlink or copy it into your project.


```bash
ln -sf ./vendor/aubreypwd/wpcs/phpcs.xml.dist ./phpcs.xml.dist
```

If you plan on changing the configuration, copy instead of symlink!

## JavaScript

To _use_ WordPress Coding Standards for JS (more to come).
